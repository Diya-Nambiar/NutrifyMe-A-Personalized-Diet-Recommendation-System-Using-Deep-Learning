# NutrifyMe-A-Personalized-Diet-Recommendation-System-Using-Deep-Learning
With the emergence of personalized health solutions,
nutrition and dietary recommendations have made tremendous
strides. This project proposes the establishment of a Personalized
diet recommendation system that leverages deep learning to
produce diet plans that address individual nutritional needs.
Using a robust dataset with rich nutritional data, the model
predicts calorie and macronutrient components of several food
items. Given the user input (calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrate specifications), the system will recommend food items
that match the user’s nutritional preferences. This personalized
meal-planning approach encourages users to engage in healthy
eating behaviors by providing individualized meal suggestions in
real-time. The deep learning model was constructed and trained
utilizing Keras and TensorFlow for food selection based upon
users’ nutritional allocation. After evaluating the food items
based on the nutritional gaps, we recommend the top 10 food
based on personal health parameters.
